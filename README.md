So far I have learned all the basics of Swift through the Codecademy swift course. THe following are the ideas I have learned: Variables, Conditionals and Logic, Loops,
Arrays and Sets, Dictionaries, Functions, and Structures. These are the basics I have learned from Codecademy. I have also learned the process of creating an XCode file
and create a repository from said file. Unfortunately I have no source code from my actual project. However, from this URL: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKgfdE_9X_Q&ab_channel=AmaanHashemee. You can see what I've learned so far.
